      <p>
        I gained the idea for this project because I live in Northern California, which has been plagued by wildfires
        every summer for the past several years. Through this data exploration and analysis, I am hoping to find out
        more about the causes, severity, and other factors concerning these fires. I am curious to see if there is some
        special factor that causes more fires in some years than others, and hope to discover more about the cause and
        effect as well. I have obtained my data from Kaggle as well as a Github repository that I found where some data
        visualizations were created concerning wildfires in the US.

      <p>
        So far, for my first dataset, I have cleaned up the data by removing all the unnecessary columns (such as
        comments). I have created a few visuals like a correlation matrix and some bar graphs. But in doing so, I
        realized I didn't have data that gave me a good estimation of wildfire severity, so I found a second dataset
        that I have begun cleaning and exploring.
